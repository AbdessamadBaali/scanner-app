# Scanner-app
HTML5 QR Code Scanner is a JavaScript library that allows you to scan QR codes from a web browser using your camera. To use it, you will need to follow these steps:


## Include the library in your HTML file:
```http
<script src="https://html5-qrcode-scanner.github.io/html5-qrcode-scanner.min.js"></script>
```

## Create a container for the scanner in your HTML file:
```http
<div id="qrcode-scanner"></div>
```

## Initialize the QR Code Scanner:file:
```http
<script>
  const scanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner("qrcode-scanner");
  scanner.start();
</script>
```

## Listen for the "scan" event to retrieve the data from the QR code:
```http
<script>
  scanner.addEventListener("scan", function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    // Perform action with the data from the QR code
  });
</script>
```

That's all you need to get started with HTML5 QR Code Scanner! You can customize the appearance and behavior of the scanner by setting various options and parameters, such as the camera type, the size of the scanner, and the types of QR codes that you want to scan. For more information, see the documentation and examples on the HTML5 QR Code Scanner website.
